    <div class="second"><b>Pollution</b> is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause
        adverse change.[1]
        Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat,
        sound, or light). Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or
        naturally occurring contaminants.</div><br><br>

    <div class="third">Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word pollution generally
        implies that the
        contaminants have an anthropogenic source that is, a source created by human activities, such as
        manufacturing, extractive industries, poor waste management, transportation or agriculture. Pollution is often
        classed as point source (coming from a highly concentrated specific site, such as a factory, mine, construction
        site), or nonpoint source pollution (coming from a widespread distributed sources, such as microplastics or
        agricultural runoff).</div><br>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <p class="forth">Pollution control is a term used in environmental management. It refers to the control of emissions
        and effluents
        into air, water or soil. Without pollution control, the waste products from overconsumption, heating,
        agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transportation and other human activities, whether they accumulate or
        disperse, will degrade the environment. In the hierarchy of controls, pollution prevention and waste
        minimization are more desirable than pollution control. In the field of land development, low impact development
        is a similar technique for the prevention of urban runoff.</p><br>
